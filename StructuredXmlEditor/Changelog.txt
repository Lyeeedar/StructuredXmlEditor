--------- 1.6.0 ---------

- Improve timelines.
 -- Keyframes can now have a duration.
 -- Timelines sequentially next to each other will share a scroll position and zoom amount.
 -- Keyframes can snap to the start/end of keyframes on other timelines in the group.
- Number items will now parse equations typed into them. (e.g. typing 3*4 will put 12 into the data).
- Add support for 'comment' elements. This should help with organising your data.
- Add a 'ReferenceDef' element that allows you to specify the Keys in a seperate element, then import those.


--------- 1.5.0 ---------

- Add support for multiediting. Either select some documents in the project view then right click -> Multiedit (this will open it as a new document), or right click on a collection and click multi edit children (this will show it in the Focus tool).
- Add support for Yaml as a data type.
- Add support for structs to 'Extend' from another struct, copying its contents and optionally overwriting any elements (do this by assigning an element the same name as that in the parent).


--------- 1.4.0 ---------

- Added a new AsciiGrid for editing ascii grids. This is a focus editor for the MultilineString element type.


--------- 1.3.0 ---------

- Add support for giving data files a custom extension, and choosing whether the data should be xml or json.
- Add a ProjectView tool that allows browsing the data files in the project.
- Add support for adding attributes to the xmldef. This is found by checking the 'HasAttributes' attribute on an element.
- Add grouping of entries in the reference dropdown. e.g. Apples,Oranges,Carrots,Cucumber -> Fruit(Apples,Oranges),Vegetables(Carrots,Cucumber).
- Allow for far more complex visibleif bindings. They can now bind to the values of attributes, and also use a path from the current node. e.g. Apples.Name or Parent.Size.
- Collections can now have multiple allowed child types. The one to be spawned can be chosen via the dropdown by the add button.
- Files now display a preview of any linked images. Additionally in the timeline if a keyframe contains a fileimage then it will display a preview of that too.


--------- 1.2.0 ---------

- Fix deleting of the Update executable.
- Make all graph links look like reference ones if FlattenData is used. Also remove the LinkType edit box.
- Slightly alter the padding of the graphnodes to waste less space.
- Add a proper error reporting and feedback system, that sends the data via email.


--------- 1.0.0 ---------

- First major release.
- Add support for loading and saving json.
- Adds support for GraphNodes, and Graph based editing.
- Added ability to generate a rough definition for a xml or json file. This show speed up the creation of definitions for existing data.
- Added a 'Swap' option to references. This attempts to swap the current data with another definition. This should make creating definitions far less painful.

- Adds dockable miscellaneous tools:
 -- Add UndoHistory tool that allows viewing and browsing the Undo history.
 -- Add StartPage that shows a fair amount of useful data.
 -- Add FocusTool that allows for easily seeing the data for the selected node in the Graph view.

- Optimised a lot.
- Removed the ability to change the element name dynamically (via ChildAsName or ValueAsName).
- Added support for updating the tool semi-automatically.
